Based on the provided code from your Jupyter Notebook, here's a suggested structure for your presentation slides, incorporating the key elements of your weather forecast prediction project:

    Introduction Slide:
        Title: "Weather Forecast Prediction using Machine Learning"
        Brief Introduction: Overview of the project's aim to predict weather conditions using a machine learning model.

    Data Collection and Preprocessing Slide:
        Source of Data: Mention where the weather data (e.g., from NCEI-Oakland International Airport) is sourced.
        Preprocessing Steps: Describe the preparation of data, focusing on the use of pandas for data handling and the selection of features like "PRECIPITATION", "TMAX", and "TMIN".

    Model Preparation Slide:
        Parameters: Explain the lookback period (30 days), forecast horizon (7 days), epochs (50), batch size (16), and validation split (10%).
        Data Preparation Function: Highlight the prepare_data function for arranging data into input-output pairs suitable for the model.

    Model Architecture and Training Slide:
        Model Architecture: Outline the Sequential model with Flatten and Dense layers, using linear activation.
        Training Process: Discuss the use of 'adam' optimizer and mean squared error (MSE) as a loss function, along with training over specified epochs and batch size.

    Model Evaluation and Results Slide:
        Evaluation Metrics: Present the model's performance using MSE on test data.
        Training Progress Graph: Display the training and validation loss graph to illustrate model learning over epochs.

    Model Application and Prediction Slide:
        Show a few examples of weather predictions made by the model.
        Discuss potential real-world applications of the model, like enhancing weather forecasting accuracy.

    Conclusion and Future Directions Slide:
        Summarize the achievements of the project.
        Suggest potential improvements, such as experimenting with different architectures, increasing data diversity, or expanding forecast horizons.

    Q&A Slide:
        Invite questions from the audience for further discussion.

Remember to include visual elements like code snippets, graphs, and diagrams to make the slides more engaging and informative. This structure leverages the technical details in your code to convey a clear and comprehensive understanding of your project.
